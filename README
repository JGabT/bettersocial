| description:
bettersocial is an application intended to merge social feeds from various platforms into one.
tl;dr : app to view facebook and twitter's feed in one app.

| upcoming features:
- free, i mean it. not the free ads app but the ads free app
- no ads (yay! no more "personalized experience bs")
- silky smooth ui and custom themes from contributors or you
- might add cross messaging (twitter facebook messages in one app!?!)
- open source (so you know i won't steal your passwords :wink:)

| progress:
bettersocial is still in early stages.
the web app is my priority. once the web app is done i will bridge it to mobile.
